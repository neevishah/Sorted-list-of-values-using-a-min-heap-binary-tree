# Sorted-list-of-values-using-a-min-heap-binary-tree
Given an unordered list of Doubles as input, produced a sorted list of the top-k Doubles as output. Used a Min Heap binary tree to maintain the top-k results of n doubles in O(n log k) time and O(k) space (not counting the space for the input array of n numbers).
